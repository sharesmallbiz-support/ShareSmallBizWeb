# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side is built with React and TypeScript, leveraging a component-based architecture with modern UI libraries:

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility and customization
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

The frontend follows a modular structure with components organized by feature, shared UI components, and custom hooks for business logic. The application uses a responsive design with support for both desktop and mobile layouts.

## Backend Architecture
The server-side uses Express.js with TypeScript in an ESM configuration:

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for API endpoints and middleware
- **Data Storage**: In-memory storage with TypeScript interfaces and Maps
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend for consistent data validation
- **Development**: Hot reloading with Vite integration for seamless development experience
- **Session Management**: Simplified authentication system (production would require proper session management)

The backend implements a RESTful API structure with routes for authentication, posts, comments, and AI interactions. It includes error handling middleware and request logging for debugging and monitoring.

## Data Storage Solutions
Pure in-memory storage system providing:

- **Type Safety**: Pure TypeScript interfaces with Zod validation schemas
- **In-Memory Maps**: Fast, reliable data storage using JavaScript Maps for all entities
- **Mock Data**: Comprehensive seed data with realistic business profiles and content
- **Data Models**: Users, posts, comments, likes, AI interactions, and business metrics

The storage system supports all social features including user profiles, business information, posts with different types (discussions, opportunities, marketing), engagement metrics, and AI interaction history. All data persists only during the application session and resets on restart, making it ideal for development and demonstrations.

## Authentication and Authorization
Currently implements a simplified authentication system for demonstration purposes:

- **Basic Login**: Username/password authentication with user lookup
- **Session Handling**: Simplified session management (requires enhancement for production)
- **User Context**: User information passed through API requests
- **Future Enhancement**: Production deployment would require proper JWT tokens, session storage, password hashing, and comprehensive security measures

## AI Integration Architecture
OpenAI integration for business intelligence features:

- **Business Advisory**: GPT-4 powered business advice with contextual user information
- **Post Suggestions**: AI-generated content recommendations for social posts
- **Engagement Analysis**: Automated analysis of post performance and engagement metrics
- **Conversation History**: Persistent storage of AI interactions for user reference

The AI service layer abstracts OpenAI API calls and provides structured responses with suggestions and actionable items tailored to small business needs.
