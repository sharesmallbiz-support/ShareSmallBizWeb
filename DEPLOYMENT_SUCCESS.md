- ✅ Serves static files from the correct path
- ✅ Handles API requests properly
- ✅ Maintains all conversation threads and user data
- ✅ Processes authentication and messaging
- ✅ Provides proper error handling and logging

## Ready for Replit Deployment

The application is now configured for successful Replit deployment with:
